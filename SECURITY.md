# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of CreativeNewEraSlides seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not** create a public issue

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Send a private report

Instead, please send an email to **CreativeNewEra@yahoo.com** with:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### 4. Coordinated Disclosure

We practice coordinated disclosure:

- We will work with you to understand and reproduce the issue
- We will develop and test a fix
- We will coordinate the public disclosure timing with you
- We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Measures

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: We use Bandit for security-focused static analysis
- **Dependency Scanning**: We use Safety to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Security checks run automatically before commits
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated security scanning in our GitHub Actions workflow

### AI Model Security

- **Model Integrity**: We verify model checksums when downloading from Hugging Face
- **Safe Loading**: We use secure model loading practices to prevent code injection
- **Isolation**: AI models run in controlled environments with limited system access
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of GPU memory to prevent information leakage

### Application Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **File System Access**: Limited and controlled file system operations
- **Network Security**: HTTPS-only connections for model downloads
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

### Data Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All AI generation happens locally on your machine
- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect or transmit user-generated content
- **Settings Privacy**: User settings are stored locally using PyQt5's QSettings
- **Temporary Files**: Secure handling and cleanup of temporary files

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Safe Model Usage

- **Trusted Sources**: Only download models from official Hugging Face repositories
- **Verify Checksums**: The application verifies model integrity during download
- **Model Storage**: Keep your Models/ directory secure and backed up

### System Security

- **Keep Updated**: Regularly update the application and its dependencies
- **Antivirus**: Run up-to-date antivirus software
- **Firewall**: Consider firewall rules if you're concerned about network access
- **User Permissions**: Run the application with appropriate user permissions (not as administrator)

### Generated Content

- **Content Review**: Review generated content before sharing
- **Copyright Awareness**: Be mindful of potential copyright issues with generated content
- **Privacy**: Don't include personal information in prompts if privacy is a concern

## Known Security Considerations

### AI Model Risks

- **Prompt Injection**: Be cautious with prompts from untrusted sources
- **Bias and Fairness**: AI models may exhibit biases present in training data
- **Content Generation**: Models may generate inappropriate content despite safeguards

### System Requirements

- **GPU Drivers**: Keep GPU drivers updated for security patches
- **CUDA**: Ensure CUDA toolkit is from official NVIDIA sources
- **Python Environment**: Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies

## Security Updates

We will notify users of security updates through:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes in CHANGELOG.md
- GitHub repository notifications
